# `submission.json` — the descriptor, in full

The descriptor is where submissions fail most often — before any code runs. This page documents it
in full. Read it before writing anything; the file format is the same for every track.

> **This track's values:** `competition_id: "agenthon2026-analysis-dev"` for the Development
> phase; the fixture to copy is `contracts/fixtures/c5/analysis_dev.json`. `category` is `api` if
> your analyst calls the house model. For a deterministic analyst that calls no model, no enum
> value is strictly truthful — declare `api` and leave `models` empty (`[]`), and say so in your report.

## Install the toolkit — one command

```
pip install "qfbench2-common @ git+https://github.com/Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public.git@v2.5.1#subdirectory=common"
```

> **Pin the tag, never a branch.** A moving branch can make your local result and your scored
> result diverge without either being wrong.

**Needs Python >= 3.13** — on 3.12 the resolver refuses outright:
`ERROR: Package 'qfbench2-common' requires a different Python: 3.12.x not in '>=3.13'`.

> One thing to watch. If an install line you find elsewhere omits `-public` from the repository
> name, or pins an older tag, do not use it — it resolves somewhere you cannot read, or to a
> pre-freeze version that yields the stale 7-key schema this page warns about below. Use the line
> above.

What the installed toolkit gives you: `image` is an object,
`additionalProperties: false`, 12 required keys, `contracts` imports, `seal_descriptor_digest`
present, and it reproduces all twelve published C5 fixture digests.

### Copy a published fixture rather than hand-writing a descriptor

The toolkit ships a **valid** descriptor per (track, phase) at
`qfbench2_common/contracts/fixtures/c5/<track>_<phase>.json`. `descriptor.py:28-30` says the Hub
publishes one for each and that *"Nobody hand-writes a third example."*

**Start from your track's fixture.** It answers `competition_id`, `category` and the `models` shape
without guesswork. The `invalid/` fixtures next to them are the negative controls.

### If you have a stale local checkout, it will pass anyway

A working copy of the toolkit pinned before the freeze carries the old 7-key schema with no
`image` object and `additionalProperties` unset — so a legacy descriptor validates cleanly against
it. `main` is fine; a stale clone is not. Check what you actually have:

```python
import json, pathlib, qfbench2_common
s = json.load(open(pathlib.Path(qfbench2_common.__file__).parent / "schemas/submission.schema.json"))
assert "image" in s["properties"] and s.get("additionalProperties") is False and len(s["required"]) == 12
```

Do not write a shim if that fails — a shim does not fail, it agrees with you. Re-clone or reinstall.

### Schema validation alone is not enough

`invalid/wrong_descriptor_digest.json` **passes** the JSON Schema and is caught only by the
toolkit's parser. Validate with `SubmissionDescriptor.from_mapping` and reseal with
`seal_descriptor_digest` (a reseal of a correct descriptor is a no-op); do not stop at `jsonschema`.

## The twelve required fields

`additionalProperties: false` — an unknown key is a validation error, not a warning.

| field | notes |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | `"1.0.0"` or `"1.1.0"` (the toolkit that ships this doc implements 1.1.0) |
| `interface_version` | `"2.0"` — must match the image's `qfbench2.interface_version` label |
| `competition_id` | `agenthon2026-<track>-<phase>`. The suffixed form is what the C5 golden fixtures and accepted submissions use. Note the toolkit contradicts itself — `contracts/release.py:106` defines the form WITHOUT the phase suffix — and **neither the schema nor the parser enforces either form**, so nothing catches a wrong value locally. Use the suffix. |
| `team_id` | **derived, not assigned.** `team-` + the first 32 hex characters of `sha256("agenthon2026-team-alias:" + str(team_number) + ":" + team_key)`, computed by `qfbench2 submission alias` / `pack` from your website team number and Team Key (hidden prompt or `--team-key-file`; never an argument). Any non-empty string validates locally, so a hand-typed wrong value is not caught here; `pack` refuses a `team_id` that disagrees with the derived one, and the organizer cancels a descriptor whose `team_id` names a team other than the one linked to your account. See `TEAM-CLAIM.md`. |
| `track` | `coding` \| `forecasting` \| `simulation` \| `analysis` |
| `phase` | `dev` \| `final` \| `verification`. These technical values remain supported. Development and registration close October 12, 2026 at 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC−12); the joint Final + Verification phase runs October 13–25 and closes October 25 at 23:59 AoE, with one final submission per team per track and no separate participant Verification submission. Follow the organizer’s phase-specific descriptor instructions. |
| `category` | `api` \| `simulator` — the enum the schema validates. `api` on Tracks 1, 2 and 4 (every submission runs against the House model; bring-your-own models and adapters are not part of this competition, and the former `byo-small` / `byo-large` values are invalid since toolkit 2.4.3), `simulator` on Track 3. The enum is **not validated against `track`** (a wrong pairing passes), so getting it right is on you. |
| `image` | **an object** — see below |
| `image_access` | `public` \| `organizer_mirror` |
| `models` | array — one entry per model you actually use; **`[]` when your submission uses no model** (C5 1.1.0) |
| `license` | An OSI-approved identifier for **your own submission** — this is your code's licence, not the task data's. Any well-formed identifier validates, so nothing catches a wrong choice. The task data are U.S. public-record documents — company filings from SEC EDGAR, plus releases from the CFTC, the U.S. Treasury, the BLS and the Federal Reserve — with the questions and cards written by the organizers around them. The government releases are public domain; the SEC filings are public record and redistributable as filed, but the filer grants no separate copyright licence and keeps whatever rights it holds in its own document. Each unit's `manifest.json` records the source and licence for every file, and the kit's `DATA-LICENSE.md` gives the default. Do not vendor task data into your submission. |
| `descriptor_digest` | Self-referential — see below. **Prefixed**, e.g. `sha256:4a7f532e...`, not bare hex — the same *format* as `image.digest`. The two values are different; they are digests of different things. |

### `image` is an object, not a string

```json
"image": {
  "registry":   "ghcr.io",
  "repository": "your-org/your-image",
  "digest":     "sha256:<64 hex>"
}
```

**Do not use `image_digest` or `model_disclosure`.** Both were replaced at the freeze, and the
toolkit ships the old shapes as *negative* fixtures —
`contracts/fixtures/c5/invalid/legacy_image_digest_field.json` and `legacy_model_disclosure.json`.
A descriptor using them is invalid on two counts: a missing required key, and an unknown one.

### The trap the kit itself sets: `house_endpoint_only`

`SUBMISSION_CLI.md` (search for `house_endpoint_only`) tells you that you "may set
`house_endpoint_only: true` in `submission.json`". **Do not.** The schema's twelve properties are
exactly:

```
category  competition_id  descriptor_digest  image  image_access  interface_version
license   models          phase              schema_version  team_id  track
```

`house_endpoint_only` is not among them, and neither are `open_weights` or `api_domains`, which
belonged to the old schema. With `additionalProperties: false` each one is a hard validation
error — `unknown field(s) [...]; the vocabulary is closed`. This deserves more attention than the
legacy fields above: those you have to dig up, whereas this one the kit actively recommends.

### `models` is required, and `[]` is the model-free answer

The key must be present — an absent key is refused, because silence is not a disclosure. A
submission that loads no weights and calls no endpoint writes the empty list, which is a positive
statement ("this submission calls no model"), not a placeholder:

```json
"models": []
```

(Until C5 1.1.0 the validator demanded at least one entry, so a model-free submission had to
invent a row such as `"name": "none-deterministic-engine"`. Do not do that any more: an invented
row makes `models` useless as evidence exactly where the disclosure rule matters.) Every entry you
DO declare still needs all five keys: `name`, `version`, `training_cutoff`, `access`, `revision`.

For an authorized `api` submission using the House model, copy the five-field disclosure row in
[House model identity](../../docs/HOUSE-MODEL.md). It records the reported model and tokenizer
snapshot and explicitly declares the unpublished training cutoff. The runtime route alias `house`
is distinct from the model identity in `models[].name`; use the injected `MODEL_NAME` for calls.
The guide explains the existing narrow base-pretraining exception and the cutoffs that still
apply to participant tuning. Reseal the descriptor after updating the row.

### `descriptor_digest`

The sha256 of the descriptor **with `descriptor_digest` itself removed**, serialised under
**RFC 8785 (JCS)** canonicalisation — sorted keys, no insignificant whitespace, canonical number
forms. Not `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)`; JCS has specific rules for numbers and string escapes.

With the toolkit:

```python
from qfbench2_common.contracts.descriptor import seal_descriptor_digest
sealed = seal_descriptor_digest(my_descriptor)   # returns the descriptor with the digest filled in
```

Hand-implementing JCS is possible, and pointless. Install the toolkit.

## The zip

Two files at the root of the archive, nothing else:

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `submission.json` | this descriptor, sealed |
| `team-claim.json` | `{"schema_version": "2.0", "site_team_id": <your team number>, "descriptor_sha256": "<sha256 of the exact `submission.json` bytes in this zip>", "proof": "<64 hex>"}` |

**Your Team Key never goes into the zip, and must not.** An uploaded submission zip is
downloadable by anyone once the run is placed on a leaderboard, so nothing secret may travel in
it. `team-claim.json` carries a *proof* instead — an HMAC computed under the key and bound to the
digest of this zip's `submission.json`. A `schema_version` `"1.0"` document, the superseded shape
that carried a `team_key` field, is refused rather than read; if you ever uploaded one, treat that
key as published and ask the organizers to rotate it.

`team-claim.json` is required on the **first upload from your CodaBench account** in a
competition and harmless afterwards: keep writing it. It is how the organizer links your account
to your team; there is no registration page. Let the toolkit write both:

```bash
qfbench2 submission pack --descriptor submission.json --team-number <N> --out submission.zip
```

It asks for the Team Key without echo (or reads `--team-key-file`), sets `team_id` to the derived
id, reseals the digest, computes the proof over the exact `submission.json` bytes it is about to
write, and writes the zip. The key is used for those two derivations and nothing else: it is never
an argument, never printed and never written anywhere. What happens on a missing or wrong claim
is in [`TEAM-CLAIM.md`](TEAM-CLAIM.md): everything except a wrong `team_id` *holds* the upload
for your next attempt rather than cancelling it.
